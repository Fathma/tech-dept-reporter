## GPT Analysis
### /home/fathma/Documents/calcuu/calcuu-backend/src/main.ts
The code does not seem to have any obvious or major technical debt. However, there are a few things that might improve scalability, security, maintainability, and testability of the system:

1. **Hard-Coded Values**: It is better to avoid hard-coded values such as the default port `'3001'`. It would be better to define constants in a separate config file or use environment variables directly. This increases maintainability and makes code more portable.

2. **Basic Authentication**: It uses Basic HTTP authentication which sends unencrypted user credentials in the header. To reduce security debt, consider using robust authentication and security measures like JWT, OAuth etc.

3. **Exception Handling**: Exceptions are directly thrown from the service layer. It would be better to have a customized exception handling mechanism. The error formatter is a step in the right direction and this could be extended.

4. **Documentation**: Code seems to be lacking comments. Commenting code is recommended especially if the codebase is to be worked on by multiple developers and increases the maintainability of the code.

5. **Environment Variables**: Environment variables like `DATABASE_PASSWORD` are directly accessed. It's recommended to use a configuration service to access these values. This can improve both security and error handling in cases where such variables are missing.

Above points are more in the line of improvements rather than technical debt. There seems to be no significant technical debt in the code being analyzed at the moment. All potential improvements could cause some tech debt if left unaddressed in the long run.
### /home/fathma/Documents/calcuu/calcuu-backend/src/app.service.ts
Tech debt is a concept in programming that reflects the extra development work that arises when code that is easy to implement in the short run is used instead of applying the best overall solution.

Analyzing the given piece of code:

1) Documentation: There is no in-line documentation present in the code file which might make the code hard to understand for new developers or reviewers.

2) Use of Magic String: The string 'Welcome to calcuu(1.0.0)!' is a magic string here. The problem with these types of string is that they are not self-explanatory, and if they need to be changed, the developer may have to do many changes.

3) The lack of configuration: The version number 1.0.0 in the string is hardcoded which increases the tech debt as we will need to manually update this each time the version changes.

4) Error Handling: The function getHello doesn't have any error handling mechanism.

5) Testing: There's no indication of testing for this function. Not having tests can lead to problems in the future if the function behavior changes.

6) This code doesn't adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). The AppService class could have responsibilities added to it in the future, violating SRP. 

Refactoring this code and incorporating good coding practices can help reduce tech debt. For instance, keeping version number in a config file and referring to that in the code, adding in-line documentation, handling errors, adding tests, and instituting proper design principles can keep tech debt to a minimum.
### /home/fathma/Documents/calcuu/calcuu-backend/src/app.module.ts
The provided code doesn't seem to have any critical technical debt, but it is not devoid of potential issues. Below are a few points based on some best practices and common principles:

1. **Lack of Code Comments**: The code lacks comments, both for the blocks and for individual functionalities. This makes it difficult for a new developer (or even the same developer in future) to understand it.

2. **Large Import Block**: There's a large block of import statements at the top of the file. This is not a direct technical debt problem but it indicates that the file might have too many responsibilities, which might violate the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). 

3. **Custom Middleware Registration**: Registering a middleware for all routes ('*') using `forRoutes({ path: '*', method: RequestMethod.ALL })` is not a problem per se. However, if there are routes which don't need this middleware, this could become a performance bottleneck.

4. **Hardcoded Fallback Language**: The fallback language ('en') is hardcoded in the I18nModule instantiation. While this seems innocent now, it may quickly snowball into a technical debt if a requirement to make the fallback language dynamic arises in the future.

5. **Lack of Error Handling**: In the configurations of modules such as I18nModule, there doesn't seem to be any error-handling mechanism present. It is important to have appropriate error handling to ensure the application behaves predictably in case of unexpected events. 

6. **Potential Module-Level Issues**: While the ``AppModule`` seems to be configured properly, technical debt might be hiding in the modules it imports, such as ``SpacesModule``, ``AuthModule ``, ``PdfModule``, and others. Evaluating technical debt would need investigating these individual modules too. 

Remember, most technical debt takes the form of trade-offs and isn't immediately bad.
